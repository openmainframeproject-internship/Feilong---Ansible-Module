So I ran over the demo of allocating storage for Vincent and discussed issues
of the Rest call to FS8K. 

Tasks :-

1. Investigate upon the usage of the Ansible adhoc commands over DS8K/FS8K CLI.
2. Work on the REST API(parameters) issue of Mapping the Volume to host and 
give status feed
3. Investigation on how we are gonna mostly get in inputs for our module.
