We had a call with the Storage expert Tom handling FS/DS8K stuff and cleared a few of the doubts relating to project.Relating to WWPN, host creation and UID mostly.

Some of the Key Points to further investigate:-
1. What if commands are executed 2 or more times
2. And what if volume names are issued same and each time how to create a new volume and attach it
Tasks:- 

1. Issuing the storage commands to
	- Set the host
	- Create a volume and host map it
	- Investigate to get UID via manual commands rather than regex
