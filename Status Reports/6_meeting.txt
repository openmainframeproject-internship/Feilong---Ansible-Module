We discussed on a bit on the project plan which will basically involve 2 phases 

								----|
1.)Communicate to Storage ask for storage it will return	    |
(which will not involve just asking for the storage)		    |
								    |
2.We need to go through manual and ask 				    |
	 							    |  Phase-1
								    |  (2 week + 1)
:-	return [WWPN]						----|


								----|
2.)	Integration of the module with Feilong			    |  Phase-2
								    |
								----|

The FS9K isn't connected to the machine physically via cables that's due right 
now but will not hinder us right now.

So mentor told the request is flow is like

	OpenStack

	 | |
      Ansible Module	
	^   |	
(WWPN)	|   |

     DS8K/FS9K storage
