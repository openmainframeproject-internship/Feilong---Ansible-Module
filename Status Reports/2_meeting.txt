We discussed on mainframe of Vicom infinity what's it is - 4 physical IFL'S in 
machine on which particularly 2 threads can run on a core so it's like  
8 processors. I guess and some IBM mainframe model discussion along with 
cooling.


Suggestion/WorkAround:- If u can't find a package or anything look into the 
			(java --> JVM) or (Node gems) which has it's own 
			compiler and is independent.
			[ Compile libraries for s390x]

Tasks

1.)  Tryout Ansible on 	suse 
			Redhat
			Ubuntu

2.) Build an ansible module to call REST API's -eg yahoo stocks API or something related to mounting the file system.
	Try to use of the Postman for the JSON request formating
